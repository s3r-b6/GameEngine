# What is this

This is a game engine pet project implemented in C++. The primary goal of this project is to create a small but flexible game engine that can be used as a foundation for various types of 2D games. The engine aims to provide developers with a set of tools without hiding anything from them.

## Key Features

- **Rendering Engine**: Utilizes OpenGL to render quads and (TODO: particles)
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Designed to run seamlessly on multiple platforms, Windows and Linux are supported right now, but should be easy enough to adapt to any other platform (that SDL does support).
- **Hot-reloading**: Hot reloading of game-logic without losing the current game state. TODO: Hot reloading of shaders and textures.
- WIP: **Asset Management**: Management of game assets such as textures and audio files to optimize memory usage and loading times.
- TODO: **Physics Simulation**: Incorporates a simple physics engine to handle interactions between game objects.
- TODO: **Scripting Support**: Provide scripting capabilities to make game development doable for level-designers and other non-technical individuals

# What this is not

This project is not a full-fledged commercial game engine (like Unity or Unreal Engine). 
It aims to offer a comprehensive set of features for game development, but it does lack advanced functionalities and optimizations found in established game engines. 
This project is primarily intended for educational purposes and personal exploration of game engine architecture and design principles. Therefore, it may not be suitable for large-scale commercial game development projects without significant enhancements and optimizations.

I primarily keep this public in the hopes that anyone can learn anything from what I have done, in the same way I have benefitted of similar efforts by other developers.

I welcome any comments, suggestions, bug fixes, and improvements. This is the first release of the code, and my first time working in a game engine and much of it is rough and unfinished.
